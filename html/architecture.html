    <h1>Computer Organization Principles</h1>
    <p>This page provides an overview of the fundamental principles of computer organization.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Computer organization involves the design and structure of hardware components that make up a computer system. These components work together to perform tasks efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Main Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#cpu">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</a></li>
        <li><a href="#memory">Memory</a></li>
        <li><a href="#input-output">Input/Output Devices</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="cpu">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p>The CPU is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and performing computations. It consists of the control unit and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU).</p>

    <h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
    <p>Memory stores both data and instructions for the CPU to process. There are two main types of memory: RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).</p>

    <h2 id="input-output">Input/Output Devices</h2>
    <p>Input/output devices allow users to interact with the computer. Common input devices include keyboards and mice, while output devices include monitors and printers.</p>

    <h2>Bus Systems</h2>
    <p>Buses are the pathways through which data travels between different components of the computer. There are several types of buses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Bus</li>
        <li>Address Bus</li>
        <li>Control Bus</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cache Memory</h2>
    <p>Cache memory is a type of very fast memory that sits between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to store frequently accessed data to speed up processing.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding computer organization principles is essential for designing efficient and effective computer systems. The interaction between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices forms the basis of computer operation.</p>
