    <h1>Welcome to Computer Networking</h1>
    <p>This page provides an overview of computer networking concepts.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Computer networking is the practice of linking computers together to exchange information and to share resources. Each computer in a network is called a node.</p>

    <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#lan">Local Area Network (LAN)</a></li>
        <li><a href="#wan">Wide Area Network (WAN)</a></li>
        <li><a href="#man">Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="lan">Local Area Network (LAN)</h2>
    <p>A LAN is a network that connects computers within a relatively small area such as a single building or a group of buildings.</p>

    <h2 id="wan">Wide Area Network (WAN)</h2>
    <p>A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, such as connecting cities or countries.</p>

    <h2 id="man">Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h2>
    <p>A MAN is a network designed to connect multiple locations within a metropolitan area, such as a city.</p>

    <h2>Networking Protocols</h2>
    <p>Networking protocols define the rules for communication between devices on a network. Some common protocols include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</li>
        <li>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</li>
        <li>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Hardware</h2>
    <p>Hardware used in networking includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Routers</li>
        <li>Switches</li>
        <li>Hubs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Computer networking is a fundamental aspect of modern computing, enabling communication and resource sharing across various types of networks.</p>
